# Vorbis
Discord Bot Vorbis
- Started development in early-january of 2021
- Uses JSON to store data (I could have made it use lists, sets, and dicts, but I wanted to try it this way lol)
- Still in Alpha Development

# - What the bot can actually do?

- Play music
- A leveling system (That can be edited via roles)
- User Profiles
- A music queueing system
- A Music playlist system (You can make public or private)
- General Administration Commands

# - What it uses

- Uses FFMPEG and YouTubeDL to play music and youtube-search-python to search for songs (https://github.com/alexmercerind/youtube-search-python Please go check this dude out, he made this bot 100% possible..)

# - Basic Story

- Was hanging out with a friend one night, we were bored and decided to make this as a fun and lightweight python project, but I got heavily into making this, and-
  he dropped out of development about 3 days after we started building it, but still, credit goes to Fabian Kuzbiel for making think of this idea,-
